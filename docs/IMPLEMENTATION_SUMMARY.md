# Implementation Summary: Enhanced API Sync Caching

## Version Update: 3.1.0 → 3.1.1

## User Requirements Implemented

### 1. ✅ 24-Hour Cache Check on Sync
**Requirement**: When user presses sync, check if API has been synced within the last 24 hours

**Implementation**:
- Modified `syncSpotPricesFromApi()` function to accept a `forceSync` parameter
- Added cache age validation before making API calls
- Regular sync buttons now check cache timestamp and use cached data if less than 24 hours old
- Users receive informative message showing cache age (e.g., "Using cached prices from 3 hours ago")

### 2. ✅ Cache-Based Refresh Instead of API Calls
**Requirement**: If synced recently, simply refresh the page to use most recent stored value

**Implementation**:
- Added `refreshFromCache()` function that updates display from cached data
- No API calls made when cache is valid (< 24 hours)
- All spot prices, displays, and summaries updated from localStorage
- History tracking includes 'cached' source type to distinguish from fresh API calls

### 3. ✅ Clear Cache Functionality in API Modal
**Requirement**: To pull new API data, user must go into API modal and press "clear api cache" button

**Implementation**:
- Added "Clear Cache" button to API configuration modal
- Added `clearApiCache()` function that removes cached data while preserving API configuration
- Added event listener for cache clearing functionality
- User receives confirmation message when cache is cleared

### 4. ✅ Force Sync from API Modal
**Implementation Enhancement**:
- Added "Sync Now" button in API modal that forces fresh API calls regardless of cache age
- Bypasses cache validation by calling `syncSpotPricesFromApi(true, true)`
- Provides users with immediate access to fresh API data when needed

### 5. ✅ Manual Price Override Functionality Preserved
**Requirement**: Ensure manual price override modal functions after user syncs

**Implementation**:
- All existing manual input functionality maintained
- "Add" buttons continue to show manual input fields
- Manual price entry, save, and cancel functionality unchanged
- Manual prices properly recorded in history with 'manual' source type

### 6. ✅ Spot Price History Storage Maintained
**Requirement**: Store user's spot price history and API pulled history in localStorage

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced history tracking with new source types:
  - 'manual' - User-entered prices
  - 'api' - Fresh API calls
  - 'cached' - Cache refreshes
  - 'default' - Default/reset values
- All history continues to be stored in localStorage under `SPOT_HISTORY_KEY`
- Backwards compatible with existing history data

## Technical Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **`app/js/constants.js`**: Updated version to 3.1.1
2. **`app/js/api.js`**: 
   - Enhanced `syncSpotPricesFromApi()` with cache checking
   - Added `clearApiCache()` and `refreshFromCache()` functions
   - Updated button state management and tooltips
3. **`app/index.html`**: Added "Sync Now" and "Clear Cache" buttons to API modal
4. **`app/js/events.js`**: Added event listeners for new buttons
5. **`docs/CHANGELOG.md`**: Documented new features
6. **`docs/LLM.md`**: Updated version and date references

### Key Functions Added:
- `clearApiCache()` - Clears cached data only, preserves API config
- `refreshFromCache()` - Updates display from cached data without API calls
- Enhanced `syncSpotPricesFromApi(showProgress, forceSync)` - Intelligent caching behavior

### User Experience Improvements:
- Clear messaging about cache usage and age
- Intuitive button placement and tooltips
- Preserved all existing workflows
- Enhanced control over when fresh API data is retrieved

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Cache Behavior**: Test sync button with fresh cache vs expired cache
2. **Manual Override**: Verify manual input works after sync operations
3. **API Modal Functions**: Test "Sync Now" and "Clear Cache" buttons
4. **History Tracking**: Verify different source types are recorded correctly
5. **Backwards Compatibility**: Test with existing data and configurations

## User Workflow Changes

### Before (v3.1.0):
- Sync buttons always made API calls when API was configured
- No cache management tools
- No distinction between cached and fresh data usage

### After (v3.1.1):
- Sync buttons respect 24-hour cache and show informative messages
- API modal provides "Sync Now" for immediate fresh data
- "Clear Cache" button allows users to reset cache when needed
- Enhanced transparency about data freshness and source

All requirements have been successfully implemented while maintaining backwards compatibility and existing functionality.
